#  Business Objectives

Organizations often struggle to answer:

* Which promotional strategies actually increase sales?
* Do discounts drive profitable demand or just traffic?

This analysis provides data-backed answers to optimize **revenue growth, pricing strategy, and marketing ROI**.

#  Dashboard Architecture

The project is structured into two analytical layers:

---

##  Demand & Performance Drivers Dashboard

Focus: **Sales & Footfall Growth**

### Key KPIs

* **Total Customer Visits:** 3.59M+
* **Average Footfall:** 239.45
* **Average Price Gap:** -$0.044
* **Stock Availability Rate:** 0%

---

### Analytical Views

####  Footfall by Promotion Intensity

* Footfall increases steadily with promotion intensity
* Highest demand occurs at intensity levels 5–7

**Insight:** Promotions directly drive traffic volume.

---

####  Average Footfall by Discount Level

* Moderate discounts generate the highest footfall
* Extremely high discounts reduce traffic after a threshold

**Insight:** Over-discounting erodes perceived value.

---

####  Ad Spend vs Footfall (Scatter Analysis)

* Strong positive correlation between ad spend and footfall
* Diminishing returns observed at peak spend levels

**Insight:** Marketing spend drives demand — but with saturation.

---

####  Top Performing vs Most Promoted Products

* Medium-tier products receive the most promotion
* Medium-tier also drives the highest footfall

**Insight:** Promotion allocation aligns with demand elasticity.

---

####  Footfall by Stock Level

* Higher stock availability correlates with higher footfall
* Stockouts suppress demand potential

**Insight:** Inventory is a hidden sales driver.

---

####  High Ad Spend but Low Footfall Products

* Identifies inefficient marketing allocation
* Highlights underperforming SKUs

**Insight:** Spend optimization opportunity.

---

#  Customer Risk & Experience Dashboard

Focus: **Returns, Sentiment & Pricing Risk**

---

### Key KPIs

* **Average Customer Sentiment:** 0.97
* **Average Return Rate:** 0.06
* **Return Rate During Promotions:** 6%

---

### Analytical Views

####  Customer Sentiment vs Promotion Intensity

* Sentiment improves as promotion intensity increases

**Insight:** Promotions enhance customer experience perception.

---

####  Return Rate by Sentiment Level

* Negative sentiment → Higher returns
* Positive sentiment → Lower returns

**Insight:** Customer experience directly impacts operational cost.

---

####  Return Rate vs Inventory Levels

* Higher inventory levels correlate with higher return clustering

**Insight:** Overstocking increases return exposure.

---

####  Return Rate by Promotion Intensity

* Returns increase at peak promotion levels

**Insight:** Aggressive promotions may drive low-quality purchases.

---

####  Sentiment When Priced Above Competitors

* Pricing above competitors lowers sentiment
* Competitive pricing improves perception

**Insight:** Price positioning influences brand experience.

---

#### 🏷 Average Sentiment by Product Tier

* Low-tier products show highest sentiment
* High-tier slightly lower but still strong

**Insight:** Value perception differs by price segment.
